AI/ML Application in 5G/6G Systems

This project explores the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a specific focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. The need to use Reinforcement Learning to solve multi objective Optimization problems gave rise to the field of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning  (MORL). On this page, we'll share some of work and collaborations related to this topic.

## About

In this project, we delve into the concepts and algorithms of Reinforcement Learning, which enables machines to learn through interaction and feedback. We explore various RL algorithms, such as Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and their applications in 5G system. This project also aims to create new RL algorithms to solve Multi Objective RL problems in 5G systems.

## Features

- Implementation of RL algorithms using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Examples of RL applications in various domains, such as game playing, robotics, and control systems.
- Explanation of fundamental RL concepts, including Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), value functions, and policy optimization.
