## AI/ML Application in 5G/6G Systems

This project explores the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a specific focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions in an environment by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. The need to use Reinforcement Learning to solve multi objective Optimization problems gave rise to the field of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning  (MORL). On this page, we'll share some of our work and collaborations related to this topic.

## About

This project also aims to create new RL algorithms to solve Multi-Objective problems in 5G and Beyond systems. Specifically, we focus on areas such as resource allocations, scheduling, traffic predictions, and more, for Network Slicing and Virtualization. These areas play a crucial role in optimizing network performance and enabling efficient management of diverse applications and services in the context of evolving wireless communication systems. By applying RL techniques, we aim to develop intelligent solutions that can adaptively optimize network resources, make dynamic scheduling decisions, and accurately predict network traffic patterns. These advancements have the potential to improve the overall efficiency, reliability, and quality of service in 5G and Beyond systems. Through this project, we contribute to the growing field of AI/ML applications in the telecommunications industry, specifically targeting the challenges and opportunities presented by next-generation wireless networks.
